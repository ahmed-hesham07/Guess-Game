# Guess-Game
This Python code implements a number guessing game. A random number between 1 and 9 is generated, and the user has 5 attempts to guess it. After each guess, the code provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game ends with a congratulatory message if the user guesses the number within the allowed trials.
